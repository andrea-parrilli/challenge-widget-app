= Widget Server

_A mock project_

== Introduction

This a REST service providing a basic API for CRUD operations on Widgets.

The aim of the service is fool around with technology and showcase a fairly simple but complete Java project based on Spring and other modern technologies.
It does not do anything really, and it shouldn't, since the business logic is merely a pretext.

== Rest API

This service publishes a rest API, documented hereby.

=== Resources

==== Widget

A widget is a mysterious device, but it can be imagined as a flat, extended object, lying horizontally in a 3-dimensional space.
Widgets will be fully described by their `height` and `width`, describing its extension on the cartesian plane, and `z`
to represent the widget position in space on the vertical axis.

Widgets can be operated on by using the resource endpoint `.../api/widget` to target all widgets, or `.../api/widget/<id>`
to target a specific widget identified by its `id`.

=== Get all Widgets

To get all Widgets in the repository, issue the following request:

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_getAll/http-request.adoc[]

This will produce a response akin to:

.response
include::{snippets}/widget_getAll/http-response.adoc[]

And the response body contains:

.response fields
include::{snippets}/widget_getAll/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Get a specific Widget

To get a specific Widget by it id, issue the following request:

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_get/http-request.adoc[]

With path parameters as follows:

include::{snippets}/widget_get/path-parameters.adoc[]

=== Create a new Widget

To create a new Widget, issue the following request:

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_post/http-request.adoc[]

The request payload is validated before further processing that might modify some of the fields.

CAUTION: Never include the `id` field with a `POST` request: setting the `id` is not allowed and will cause a request to fail.

.request fields
include::{snippets}/widget_post/request-fields.adoc[]

This will return the Widget that has been created with its effective properties.
In facts, the backend might modify some of the submitted properties in order to maintain internal constraints for the whole set of Widgets.

.response body
include::{snippets}/widget_post/response-body.adoc[]

The response body contains the following:

.response fields
include::{snippets}/widget_post/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Delete a Widget

To delete a Widget, its `id` must be known.

NOTE: If no Widget with the given `id` exists, the request succeeds anyway, since the expected result, i.e. the absence of a Widget with the given `id`, has been achieved.

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_delete/http-request.adoc[]

With path parameters as follows:

include::{snippets}/widget_delete/path-parameters.adoc[]

The response has no body:

.response
include::{snippets}/widget_delete/http-response.adoc[]

=== Replace a Widget

To completely replace a Widget, a new valid Widget has to be submitted as follows:

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_put/http-request.adoc[]

WARNING: Including the `id` in a `PUT` request payload will cause the request to fail.
The `id` is assigned by the system and cannot be modified.

With path parameters:

include::{snippets}/widget_put/path-parameters.adoc[]

Success will produce the resulting newly replaced Widget.
The Widget service might modify some of the Widget properties to preserve internal constraints on the complete set of Widgets.

.response
include::{snippets}/widget_put/http-response.adoc[]

With fields:

.response fields
include::{snippets}/widget_put/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Modify Widget's fields

To modify selected fields of an existing Widget, the following request can be used:

.request
include::{snippets}/widget_patch/http-request.adoc[]

Only include the fields to be modified in the payload.

WARNING: Including the `id` in a `PATCH` request payload will cause the request to fail.
The `id` is assigned by the system and cannot be modified.

The path parameters are as follows:

include::{snippets}/widget_patch/path-parameters.adoc[]

The response will contain the new Widget state as stored in the Widget service.
The Widget service might modify some of the Widget properties to preserve internal constraints on the complete set of Widgets.

include::{snippets}/widget_patch/http-response.adoc[]

With fields:

include::{snippets}/widget_patch/response-fields.adoc[]
